# SQL:
### What's SQL?
- Structured Query Language is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform datafrom a relational database.

- A relational database represents a collection of related tables (two-dimensional).Each of them are similar to an Excel spreadSheet, with a fixed number of named columns and any number of rows of data.

- There are many popular SQL database including SQLite, MySQL, Postgress, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

- To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write select statements, which are often colloquality refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
