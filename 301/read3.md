# JavaScript templating:
- JavaScript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript by using a JSON data source. 

- Template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

- Mustache is a logic template syntax.
- It can be used for HTML, configure files, source code. It works by expanding tags in template using values provided in a hash or object.

- Mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It's often considered the base for JavaScript templating.

- Since mustache supports various languages, we don't need a separate templating system on the server side.
