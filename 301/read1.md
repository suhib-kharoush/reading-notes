# Floats:

### what's float?

### what are floats used for?
- Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

- Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances.

- clearing the float:
- An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float

- the great collapse:
- One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element).

- Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has.
