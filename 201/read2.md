# Headings in HTML:
- HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
- <h1> is used for main headings
- <h2> is used for subheadings
- If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
<h3> element is used, and so
on...

# Paragraphs:
- To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening <p>
tag and closing </p> tag.

# Bold and italic:
- By enclosing words in the tags
<b> and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.

- The <b> element also represents
a section of text that would be
presented in a visually different
way (for example key words in a
paragraph) although the use of
the <b> element does not imply
any additional meaning.

# Superscript $ Subscript:
- The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.
- The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H2
0.

# Line brakes $ horizontal rules:
- As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag <br />.
- To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the <hr /> tag.

## Semantic markup:
- There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the
pages — they are known as semantic markup.

# Strong $ emphasis:
- The use of the <strong>
element indicates that its
content has strong importance.
For example, the words
contained in this element might
be said with strong emphasis.
By default, browsers will show
the contents of a <strong>
element in bold.
- The <em> element indicates
emphasis that subtly changes
the meaning of a sentence.
By default browsers will show
the contents of an <em> element
in italic.

# Abbreviation & acronyms:
- If you use an abbreviation or
an acronym, then the <abbr>
element can be used. A title
attribute on the opening tag is
used to specify the full term.
- In HTML 4 there was a separate
<acronym> element for
acronyms. To spell out the full
form of the acronym, the title
attribute was used (as with the
<abbr> element above). HTML5
just uses the <abbr> element
for both abbreviations and
acronyms.

### summary:
- HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page.
- they also provide semantic information.

# Introducing CSS:
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the
way that each individual box (and the contents
of that box) is presented.
#### CSS rule contain 2 parts:
- 1. sector.
- 2. declaration.

### How CSS rules cascade?
- If there are two or more rules
that apply to the same element,
it is important to understand
which will take precedence. 

### summary:
- CSS treates each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- rules are made up of selectors and declarations.
- different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

# Basic JavaScript instructions:
- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 
- You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code. 

### what's the variable?
- A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables. 

### Arrays:
- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

# Decision & loops:

## Switch statement:
- A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value.
