# layout:

### containing elements:
- containing or parent element is the outer box when block-level sits inside another one

- we have three types of positioning schemes:
- 1. normal flow
- 2. relative positioning
- 3. absolute positioning

- in normal flow, each block-level elements sits on the top of the next one

- in relative position, the element moves in relation to where it would have been in normal flow.

- in absolute position, when the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page.

- fixed position is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.

- float elements: it's a property that allows to me to move an element to the right or left depending on what I do

- designers often create the pages with around 960-1000pixels wide as a result of screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much.

- layout grids: composotion in any visual art is the placement or arrangement of visual elements-how they are organized on page.
