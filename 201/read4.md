# writing links:
- Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

### mail links:
- we use (mailto) to create a link that starts up the user email.

### opening linls in a new window:
- if we want to open the link in new window we can use (target) attribute on the opening tag <a>.
- this is an example:
- <a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">
Internet Movie Database</a> (opens in new window)

### summary of links:
- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.


# layout:

### normal flow:
- position: static
- In normal flow, each block-level
element sits on top of the next
one.

### relative positioning:
- Relative positioning moves an
element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow.

### absolute positioning:
- When the position property
is given a value of absolute,
the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the
position of other elements on
the page.

### fixed positioning:
- Fixed positioning is a type
of absolute positioning that
requires the position property
to have a value of fixed.

### floating:
- The float property allows you
to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

### fixed width layout:
- To create a fixed width layout,
the width of the main boxes on
a page will usually be specified
in pixels (and sometimes their
height, too).

### liquid layout:
- The liquid layout uses
percentages to specify the width
of each box so that the design
will stretch to fit the size of the
screen.

# what is the function?
- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
### how to declare a function?
- to creste a function, we give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces
