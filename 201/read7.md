# tables:
### what is a table?
- "A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results."

### basic table structure:
- table
The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

- we usually start each row using < tr > tag, then when finish the row we use closing tag < /tr >


- to make a cell on the table, we use < td > element for each cell, and then close it with < /td >.

### spanning columns:
- when we need the entries in a table to strech across more than one column.

### spanning rows:
- also when we need entries in table and strech it down across more than one row, we use spanning rows(rowspan).


### width and spacing:
-"The width attribute was used
on the opening < table> tag to
indicate how wide that table
should be and on some opening
< th> and < td> tags to specify
the width of individual cells.
The value of this attribute is
the width of the table or cell in
pixels".




### create many: constructor notation
- object constructor can use a function as a template for creating other objects.


- there are different ways to create objects:
- 1. literal notation
- 2. object constructor notation

### this:
- The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
It allows us to access the property inside the function. 


- we store data in JavaScript by using array and object, it's also known as a key.

### summary:
-"Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other)."
