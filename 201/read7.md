# tables:
### what is a table?
- A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.

### basic table structure:
- table
The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.
tr
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening tr tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
td elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing tr tag.
td
Each cell of a table is
represented using a td
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing td tag.

### spanning columns:
- Sometimes you may need the
entries in a table to stretch
across more than one column.
The colspan attribute can be
used on a th or td element
and indicates how many columns
that cell should run across.

### spanning rows:
- You may also need entries in
a table to stretch down across
more than one row.
The rowspan attribute can be
used on a th or td element
to indicate how many rows a cell
should span down the table.

### create many: constructor notation
- Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things.
Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects.
First, create the template with the object's properties and methods. 

### this:
- The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. 

### summary:
- Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
