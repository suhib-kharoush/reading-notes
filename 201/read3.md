# lists
### ordered lists:
- <ol>
The ordered list is created with
the <ol> element.

- <li>
Each item in the list is placed
between an opening <li> tag
and a closing </li> tag. (The li
stands for list item.)

### unordered lists:
-<ul>
The unordered list is created
with the <ul> element.

### definition lists:
- <dl>
The definition list is created with
the <dl> element and usually
consists of a series of terms and
their definitions.
- <dt>
This is used to contain the term
being defined (the definition
term).
- <dd>
This is used to contain the
definition.

### nested lists:
- You can put a second list inside
an <li> element to create a sublist or nested list.

- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered,
unordered, and definition.
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

# boxes
### box dimentions:
- By default a box is sized just big
enough to hold its contents. To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.

### limiting height:
- In the same way that you might
want to limit the width of a box
on a page, you may also want
to limit the height of it. This is
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.

### border width:
- The border-width property
is used to control the width
of a border. The value of this
property can either be given
in pixels or using one of the
following values:
thin
medium
thick

### border images:
- The border-image property
applies an image to the border of
any box. It takes a background
image and slices it into nine
pieces. 

### summary:
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

# arrays:
- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

### switch statement:
- A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value. 

### summary:
- Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
- switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
