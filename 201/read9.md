# forms:
- form controls:
- there are a several types of form controls that we can use to collect information from website users.

- how forms work?
-when the user fill the form as what allows to him add in the form and then press a button to submit the information that added by him to the server.

- form structure :
- Form controls live inside a
(form) element.
- for example
-(<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
method="get">
<p>This is where the form controls will appear.
 </p>
</form>)

# lists, tables and forms:

- list-style-type:
-The list-style-type property
allows us to control the shape
or style of a bullet point (also
known as a marker).

- list-style-image:
- we can specify an image inestead of normal point.


# events:

- traditional DOM event handlers:
- All modern browsers understand this way of creating an event handler,
but we can only attach one function to each event handler. 


- event object:
- When an event occurs, the event object tells
you information about the event, and the
element it happened upon. 

- event delegation:
- Creating event listeners for a lot of elements
can slow down a page, but event flow allows
you to listen for an event on a parent element. 

- the HTML elements we can interact with,such as links and formelements,can gain focus.

- where the event occur?
- the event object can tell us where the cursor was positioned when an event was triggered.
