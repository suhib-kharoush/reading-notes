# images:

### adding images:
- To add an image into the page
you need to use an <img>
element. 

### height and width of images:
- height
This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.
- width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.
Images often take longer to
load than the HTML code that
makes up the rest of the page.
- It is, therefore, a good idea to
specify the size of the image
so that the browser can render
the rest of the text on the page
while leaving the right amount of
space for the image that is still
loading.

### main rules for creating images:
- 1. save images in the right format
- 2. save images at the right size
- 3. use the correct resolution

### figure and figure captions:
- Images often come with
captions. HTML5 has introduced
a new <figure> element to
contain images and their caption
so that the two are associated.
You can have more than one
image inside the <figure>
element as long as they all share
the same caption.
- The <figcaption> element has
been added to HTML5 in order
to allow web page authors to add
a caption to an image.

# color:

### color:
- The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element.

### background color:
- CSS treats each HTML element
as if it appears in a box, and the
background-color property
sets the color of the background
for that box.

### opacity:
- CSS3 introduces the opacity
property which allows you to
specify the opacity of an element
and any of its child elements.
The value is a number between
0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5
is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15%
opacity).

# text:

### font family:
- The font-family property
allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.

### font size:
- The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:
pixels
Pixels are commonly used
because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.

### uppercase and lowercase:
- text-transform:
- The text-transform property
is used to change the case of
text giving it one of the following
values:
uppercase
This causes the text to appear
uppercase.
lowercase
This causes the text to appear
lowercase.

### letter and word spacing:
- Kerning is the term
typographers use for the space
between each letter. You can
control the space between each
letter with the letter-spacing
property.
It is particularly helpful to
increase the kerning when
your heading or sentence is
all in uppercase. If your text is
in sentence (or normal) case,
increasing or decreasing the
kerning can make it harder to
read.
