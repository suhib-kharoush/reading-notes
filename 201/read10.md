# error handling and debugging:
#### the stack:
- javaScript stops the process one line of code at a time.

- we can do a couple of things with errors:
- the first one is debugthe script to fix errors:
- If we come across an error while writing a script
, we will need to
debug the code, track down the source of the error,
and fix it.

- the second one is handle errors gracefully:
- we can handle errors gracefully using try, catch,
throw, and f i na 1 ly statements. 

#### what's the debugging?
- Debugging is about deduction: eliminating potential causes of an error.

- the console show us when there is an error in our code, and disply the line which has an error
