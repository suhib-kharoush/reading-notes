# Django

### Install Django:
- Before you can use Django, you’ll need to install it. Our complete installation guide covers all the possibilities; this guide will get you to a simple, minimal installation that’ll work while you walk through the introduction.

### How Django Works Behind the Scenes:
- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.

- Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code.

- Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others.

-  Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control.

- Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.

### Django Software Foundation:
- The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

### Technical Organization:
- The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.
