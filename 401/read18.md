# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

- One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

### Encrypting a message:
- The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

### Decrypting a message:
- According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

### Cracking the cipher:

- There are three main techniques he could use: frequency analysis, known plaintext, and brute force.
- - Frequency analysis
- - Known plaintext
- - Brute force

- 
Caesar's enemy wouldn't have a computer to help them, but it likely would take them less than an hour if they understood the idea of the Caesar Cipher


### Caesar cipher:
- Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.

### Breaking the cipher:
- The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:
- - an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme;
- - an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.
