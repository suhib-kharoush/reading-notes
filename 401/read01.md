# Pain and Suffering:
- The pain that I’ll experience during this course is no exception; most times it won’t feel good. I won’t feel good.

- Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams, no ambition, no aspiration.

# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation:
- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

### O(1):
- O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

### O(N):
- O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

### O(N²):
- O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

### O(2^N):
- O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. 

### Logarithms:
- Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.
