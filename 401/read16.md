- This data science primer will cover exploratory analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and model training.

- we suggest the following two tips to making the most out of this primer:
- - Tip #1 - Don’t sweat the details (for now).
- - Tip #2 - Don’t worry about coding (yet).

### Exploratory Analysis:
- There’s a big challenge in data science called “Tactical Hell.”

### Data Cleaning:
- Proper data cleaning is the “secret” sauce behind machine learning… Well, it’s not really a “secret”… It’s just a bit boring, so no one really talks about it.

### Feature Engineering:
- In a nutshell, “feature engineering” is creating new model input features from your existing ones.

- ‘Applied machine learning’ is basically feature engineering.”

### Algorithm Selection:
- we will focus on intuition and practical benefits over math and theory.

- We have two main goals:
- - To explain powerful mechanisms in modern ML.
- - To introduce several algorithms that use those mechanisms.

### Model Training:
- Data scientists actually do spend most their time on the earlier steps:
- - Exploring the data.
- - Cleaning the data.
- - Engineering new features.
