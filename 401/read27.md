# Django Using models

- Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.

### Designing the LocalLibrary models:
- Before you jump in and start coding the models, it's worth taking a few minutes to think about what data we need to store and the relationships between the different objects.

- We've created models for the book (the generic details of the book), book instance (status of specific physical copies of the book available in the system), and author. We have also decided to have a model for the genre so that values can be created/selected through the admin interface.

### Model primer:
- This section provides a brief overview of how a model is defined and some of the more important fields and field arguments.

- Model definition:
- - Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata.

- Model management:
- - Once you've defined your model classes you can use them to create, update, or delete records, and to run queries to get all records or particular subsets of records. We'll show you how to do that in the tutorial when we define our views, but here is a brief summary.

- Searching for records:
- You can search for records that match certain criteria using the model's objects attribute (provided by the base class).

### Defining the LocalLibrary Models:
- In this section we will start defining the models for the library. Open models.py (in /locallibrary/catalog/). The boilerplate at the top of the page imports the models module, which contains the model base class models.Model that our models will inherit from.

- Book model:
- Copy the Book model below and again paste it into the bottom of your file. The Book model represents all information about an available book in a general sense, but not a particular physical "instance" or "copy" available for loan. The model uses a CharField to represent the book's title and isbn .

### Re-run the database migrations:
- All your models have now been created. Now re-run your database migrations to add them to your database.

# Django Admin
- The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data. The admin application can also be useful for managing data in production, depending on the type of website.

### Creating a superuser:
- In order to log into the admin site, we need a user account with Staff status enabled. In order to view and create records we also need this user to have permissions to manage all our objects.  You can create a "superuser" account that has full access to the site and all needed permissions using manage.py.

### Logging in and using the site:
- This part of the site displays all our models, grouped by installed application. You can click on a model name to go to a screen that lists all its associated records, and you can further click on those records to edit them. You can also directly click the Add link next to each model to start creating a record of that type.

- Click on the Add link to the right of Books to create a new book (this will display a dialog much like the one below). Note how the titles of each field, the type of widget used, and the help_text (if any) match the values you specified in the model. 

- Enter values for the fields. You can create new authors or genres by pressing the + button next to the respective fields (or select existing values from the lists if you've already created them). When you're done you can press SAVE, Save and add another, or Save and continue editing to save the record.

- When you've finished adding books, click on the Home link in the top bookmark to be taken back to the main admin page. Then click on the Books link to display the current list of books (or on one of the other links to see other model lists). Now that you've added a few books, the list might look similar to the screenshot below. The title of each book is displayed; this is the value returned in the Book model's __str__() method that we specified in the last article.

- From this list you can delete books by selecting the checkbox next to the book you don't want, selecting the delete... action from the Action drop-down list, and then pressing the Go button. You can also add new books by pressing the ADD BOOK button.

- Now navigate back to the Home page (using the Home link in the breadcrumb trail) and then view the Author and Genre lists â€” you should already have quite a few created from when you added the new books, but feel free to add some more.

### Advanced configuration
- Django does a pretty good job of creating a basic admin site using the information from the registered models:
- - Each model has a list of individual records, identified by the string created with the model's __str__() method, and linked to detail views/forms for editing. By default, this view has an action menu at the top that you can use to perform bulk delete operations on records.
- - The model detail record forms for editing and adding records contain all the fields in the model, laid out vertically in their declaration order.
