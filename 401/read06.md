# Random module in python:

- When to use it?
- We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc.

- Shuffle:
- The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

- Randrange:
- Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

# Introduction to software testing:

- What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
- The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

- Why use Risk Analysis?
- In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

-  Now, you might think what could be the possible risks that you could encounter? Well here is a list:
 - - Use of new hardware
 - - Use of new technology
 - - Use of new automation tool
 - - The sequence of code
 - - Availability of test resources for the application

 - Now, you must know there are certain risks that are unavoidable. I am enumerating them below:
 - - The time that you allocated for testing
 - - A defect leakage due to the complexity or size of the application
 - - Urgency from the clients to deliver the project
- - Incomplete requirements

- In such cases, you have to tackle the situation with care. Following points can be taken care of:
- - Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting
- - Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas
- - Create a Risk Assessment database for future use
- - Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, medium, low.
