## wha's the growthmind set?
- A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.
1. Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:

2. Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset
- Challenges
 - - Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: learning Java. I studied a bit of Java at university, and have worked with it in almost every role I’ve had (including my current gig as a developer on Jira Software), and yet I still find it hard to get my head around.

 -  Obstacles
  - - My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else. I lose focus, just like it says in the chart above.
  -  Effort
   - - I have similar troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful.
   - Criticism
    - - I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done.
    - Success of others
  - - My team inclydes some of the smartest people I’ve ever worked with. But I didn’t always think this way.
