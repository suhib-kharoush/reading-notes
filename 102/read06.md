- # introduction to css:
- css allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.
- the key understanding how css works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
- css works by associating rules with HTML elements. these rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
- css rules contain  2 parts:
- 1. selector 
- 2. declaration
- using external css:
- <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the css file used to style the page.
- using internal css:
- <style> You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page.
- ### why use exernal style sheets?
- when building a website there are several advantages to placing your css rules in separate style sheet.
- summary:
- 1. css treats each HTML elements as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- 2. rules are made up of selectors and declarations.
- 3. declarations are made up of two parts:
 - the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties.
 - 4. css rules usually appear in separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
